                    <div class="headOne">Mediterranean Diet</div>

                    <div class="textOneContainer">

                        Inspired by the traditional eating patterns of southern Italy and Greece, the Mediterranean diet is deemed
                        “the gold standard in preventive medicine,” due to its “harmonic combination” of antioxidants and anti-inflammatory properties, 
                        according to a review of studies. Rich in fresh fruit, vegetables, legumes, whole grains and fish, this diet yields health benefits,
                        including increased life expectancy, reduced risk of chronic disease and improved quality of life. What’s more, the Mediterranean diet 
                        is easy to adopt, thanks to its slew of resources—which range from supportive apps to meal delivery services.
                        “It’s not surprising that the Mediterranean diet ranked number one,” says Jackie Newgent , a registered dietitian, 
                        Forbes Health Advisory Board member and panelist for our best diets ranking. “First, it’s not a ‘diet’ as we have come 
                        to think of diets; it’s a lifestyle. Following it means you will be selecting foods that are fresh and wholesome—and you’ll 
                        have plenty of flexibility. Because it’s designed more as an eating lifestyle, it doesn’t lead to ‘yo-yo’ dieting. There are no 
                        ‘good’ or ‘bad’ food lists to choose from.”

                    <div class="headTwo">Dash Diet</div>

                    <div class="textTwoContainer">

                        The DASH (Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension) diet was designed specifically with heart health in mind.
                        It takes a low-sodium approach to eating, and studies show the DASH diet effectively lowers blood pressure and
                        “bad” LDL cholesterol. “You may find it harder to eat out with the reduced sodium … and cooking without adding
                        salt may be more challenging as well, but adding in spices and herbs can make this diet even healthier,” says Melina Jampolis, 
                        M.D, a board-certified physician nutritionist, Forbes Health Advisory Board member and panelist for our best diets ranking. The DASH diet 
                        recommends meals rich in fruits, vegetables and low-fat dairy and limited in saturated fat. On the DASH diet, you use a chart to estimate 
                        your daily calorie needs, which are then used to figure out how many servings from each food group you should have.

                    <div class="headThree">Flexitarian Diet</div>

                    <div class="textThreeContainer">

                        For those who want to reap the benefits of a plant-based eating plan, but don’t feel like they can or want to commit 
                        to giving up that slab of bacon at brunch quite yet, the flexitarian diet might be a good fit. Described by the International 
                        Food Information Council as a “semi-vegetarian, plant-forward diet,” the flexitarian diet emphasizes plant-based foods (like fruits, 
                        vegetables and legumes) dairy and eggs, and recommends less frequent and/or smaller portions of meat. The organization notes that 
                        emerging research suggests this way of eating may have benefits ranging from weight management to reduced risk of cardiovascular 
                        disease and diabetes. This eating plan encourages followers to think about what can be added to their plate, as opposed to what 
                        should be taken away, according to the International Food Information Council.

                    <div class="headFour">MIND Diet</div>

                    <div class="textFourContainer">

                        Research has found that the MIND (Mediterranean-DASH Intervention for Neurodegenerative Delay) diet substantially slows cognitive 
                        decline with age. Further, studies have also found that the MIND diet is associated with better cognitive functioning independent 
                        of common brain pathology, suggesting it may contribute to cognitive resilience in the elderly.

                        <br>“This diet is a combination of the Mediterranean diet and the DASH diet, so it’s both heart-healthy and, again, the moderate 
                        carbs could give it a little edge over the DASH diet for diabetes,” says Dr. Jampolis. “It may be a little more challenging to hit 
                        the specific weekly food targets, but if you do, your brain will surely benefit.”<br>The MIND diet combines certain hallmarks of the 
                        Mediterranean and DASH diets, emphasizing a plant-based plate and limited intake of animal products and highly-saturated fats.

                    <div class="headFive">Vegetarian Diet</div>

                    <div class="textFiveContainer">

                        The classic vegetarian diet snags a spot on our ranking, earning high marks for its safety and ability to boost heart 
                        health, as well as for being a particularly healthy option for people with diabetes. Additionally, research has found 
                        that a lifelong adherence to to a vegetarian diet was associated with a 35% lower risk of developing diabetes, and those
                         who adopted a vegetarian diet after being non-vegetarian had a 53% lower risk of developing the condition compared to non-vegetarians.

                        <br>“A vegetarian diet is a terrific approach to get more plants into your eating plan, which is a key reason why it’s 
                        a diet winner,” says Newgent. “While there are several types of vegetarian diets, the most popular is a lacto-ovo vegetarian 
                        diet, which includes dairy and eggs—making it easier to follow and meet nutritional needs than if going vegan or 100% plant-based.”

                        <br>“For people who dine out or travel frequently, or who have a chaotic work or family schedule, a vegetarian diet 
                        offers plenty of flexibility,” she adds. “There are no detailed food charts, nonsensical food avoidance lists or ‘rules,’ 
                        or specific meal timing to worry about. And pizza is included!”

                        tools to log meals and measurements and a range of meal plans from Mediterranean to High Protein. It also offers a “quick start”

                        Another iteration of vegetarianism, the pescatarian diet—which is mainly plant-based with the inclusion of fish and other seafood—earned
                        high marks for categories like ease of use and safety. A 2020 study found that pescatarians are less likely to be living with obesity and 
                        have a lower prevalence of cardiovascular risk factors such as high BMI, hypertension and hypercholesterolaemia.
                        <br>“Studies consistently show that vegetarian diets are associated with a lower risk of diabetes, heart disease and less weight gain/lower 
                        weight than diets that include animal protein/meat, however they can be restrictive, so a pescatarian diet that includes fish is less restrictive 
                        and can make a predominantly plant-based diet more livable,” says Dr. Jampolis.
                        Followers of this diet are less likely to struggle with obesity or hypertension.

                        This diet emphasizes not only the foods you consume, but exercise and stress management, too. Developed by Dean Ornish, M.D., 
                        this diet is based on research that found comprehensive lifestyle changes may be able to regress coronary heart disease and other chronic conditions.

                        <br>“The Ornish diet really emphasizes foods that help with heart health like fruits, vegetables, whole grains and legumes,” says Amidor.
                        “It also promotes low fat, low added sugar and low refined carbs. The plan also emphasizes stress management and exercise, which are also important in a healthy lifestyle.”
                        Does not completely ban certain foods. Recommended foods include healthy carbs, fats and plant-based proteins.
                        Framework includes aerobic exercise and stress management. Requires no more than 10% of calories from fats and no more than 10 milligrams of cholesterol per day.
